<title>All About Stuart</title>
</head>

<body>
I am Stuart Hembree Sutton.

I am from Houston, TX. I formerly studied at Texas A&M University. I have a dog and two 
guitars. I have a propensity to begin sentences with the word "I". This is not always the 
case.

The Beatles > Elvis. Tarantino is wrong.

Text Wrangler.
